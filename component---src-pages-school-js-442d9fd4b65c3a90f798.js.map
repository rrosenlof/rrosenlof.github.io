I will graduate in April 2021 with my bachelor's of science in Information Systems and a master's degree in Information Systems Management. In fall of 2019, I took classes about:</p>\n      <ul class=\"work-section-list\">\n        <li>Data analytics (Python, SAS JMP)</li>\n        <li>Enterprise infrastructure (AWS Products)</li>\n        <li>Mobile app development (Swift for iOS apps)</li>\n        <li>Cybersecurity</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>And in the winter of 2020, I am taking classes about:</p>\n      <ul class=\"work-section-list\">\n        <li>Advanced Database Management (Oracle, Cassandra tools)</li>\n        <li>Data Structures</li>\n        <li>Business Strategy</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>I've enjoyed diving deeper into subjects that I've studied before.

After a two year pause and some searching, I landed upon the <a href=\"https://marriottschool.byu.edu/infosys/\">Information Systems</a> program in the Marriott School of Business. I loved the combination of technical and business classes offered, since I was (and still am!) uncertain of my future career path.</p>\n      <p>I started the program in the fall of 2018. Over that school year, I took classes covering the following subjects:</p>   \n      <ul class=\"work-section-list\">\n        <li>C# ASP.Net programming</li>\n        <li>SQL and database design</li>\n        <li>Project management</li>\n        <li>Django Python programming</li>\n        <li>Machine learning in Azure ML Studio</li>\n        <li>IT networking</li>\n        <li>Cybersecurity</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>It was a difficult two semesters, but I got a lot of help from great team members and professors.</p>\n    </div>  \n    \n    <SiteLinks></SiteLinks>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default SchoolPage"],"sourceRoot":""}
