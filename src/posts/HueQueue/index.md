description: "NPM package of color palettes"
---
Inspired by a similar NPM [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromotome), I created this small collection of color palettes for use in various coding projects.
​
## Process
I love pairing groups of colors together, although I'm certainly no expert! I took a lot of the color pairings from various photos I had taken in the past, and tried to group them based on 

I also chose the characteristics of the palettes that would be useful in projects, and created several methods to query the JSON file of palettes. In all, the package is pretty small and simple, but I can see it having a lot of use cases in different projects, especially generative art projects.

NPM makes creating and hosting a package super easy. The whole process took only a few minutes. I'm looking forward to finding other possible NPM packages I can make – for simple functions that an API wouldn't be necessary.

## Finished Product
The package can be found and used here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/hue-queue

I also created a simple site for showcasing the package here: http://hue-queue.surge.sh/

I would love to add more color palettes, and add more information to those palettes, but I'm happy with what I've been able to make so far!
