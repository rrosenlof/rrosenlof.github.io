I've always been a fan of photography, and art in general. I first remember really getting into taking pictures when I discovered the manual settings on my parents digital SLR camera. I loved taking long exposure photos.

Nowadays, I like shooting 35mm film in a Canon AE-1 that I got from eBay or other cheap cameras I find at thrift stores. I also use an Olympus PEN Mini E-PM2 that I got after graduating high school. Someday I'll buy a more expensive camera, maybe...
